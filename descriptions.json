After an EAP packet exchange and the user is successfully authenticated, the EAP-Success is sent from the AP to the client. If the user fails to authenticate, an EAP-Failure is sent. In this attack, EAP-Failure or EAP-Success frames are spoofed from the access point to the client to disrupting the authentication state on the client. This confuses the client’s state causing it to drop the AP connection. By continuously sending EAP Success or Failure messages, an attacker can effectively prevent the client from authenticating with the APs in the WLAN."
