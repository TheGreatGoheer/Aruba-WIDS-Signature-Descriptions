    "description": "When a client sets the HT capability “intolerant bit” to indicate that it is unable to participate in a 40MHz BSS, the AP must use lower data rates with all of its clients. Network administrators often want to know if there are devices that are advertising 40MHz intolerance, as this can impact the performance of the network."
